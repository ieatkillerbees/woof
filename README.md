Woof - A simple DataDogStatsD Client for PHP 5.4+

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/squinones/woof.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/squinones/woof)

Woof is a simple PHP client for the DataDog agent, used to send metrics information to DataDog.

Woof uses non-blocking UDP connections to send data with a minimal risk to application perfomance and is *deeply* inspired by [Alex Corsley's library](https://github.com/anthroprose/php-datadogstatsd)
